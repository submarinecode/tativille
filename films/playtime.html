                        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                        <p>Monsieur Hulot navigates a hyper-modern and baffling Paris filled with gadgets, architecture, and confusion. As the iconic character wanders through the city, he encounters a group of American tourists, leading to a series of comedic encounters in an increasingly impersonal urban landscape.</p>
                        <p>The film unfolds as a nearly plotless series of encounters and observations, culminating in an extended sequence at the grand opening of a modern restaurant that gradually descends into joyful chaos, revealing the humanity beneath the sterile modern veneer.</p>

                                <p>Tati shows how modern architecture creates a sense of uniformity and disorientation, where all spaces look essentially the same.</p>

                        <h2>Technical Innovations</h2>
                        <p>Playtime represents Tati's most ambitious and experimental work, featuring several groundbreaking technical achievements:</p>
                        <ul class="film-list">
                            <li><strong>Tativille:</strong> Unable to find suitable locations, Tati constructed a massive set (dubbed "Tativille") that included real working buildings, streets, and a functioning airport-like terminal.</li>
                            <li><strong>70mm Filming:</strong> Shot in 70mm, the film showcases extraordinary depth of field and visual clarity, allowing Tati to fill the frame with multiple gags occurring simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sound Design:</strong> The film features intricate, layered sound design, capturing the mechanical sounds of modern life while using minimal dialogue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Democratic Framing:</strong> Tati eschews traditional close-ups, instead using wide shots that allow viewers to choose what to focus on within the busy frame.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="film-section">
                        <h2>Critical Reception & Legacy</h2>
                        <p>Upon its release, Playtime was a commercial failure that nearly bankrupted Tati, largely due to its enormous production costs. However, it has since been recognized as his masterpiece and one of the great achievements in cinema.</p>
                        <p>In 2012, Sight & Sound magazine ranked Playtime as the 43rd greatest film of all time in its critics' poll. Influential filmmakers including Wes Anderson, David Lynch, and Stanley Kubrick have cited Playtime as an inspiration for their own work.</p>
                        <p>The film is celebrated for its visual comedy, social commentary, and extraordinary formal precision. Its influence can be seen in architecture, design, and film studies, where it's often used as an exemplar of how cinema can critique and illuminate modern life.</p>
