## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open index.html in your web browser to view the site
3. No build tools or server setup required - it's a static website

## Image Placeholders

The website currently uses placeholder images that should be replaced with properly licensed content before publication. Image placeholders are located in the images directory with descriptive filenames indicating their intended content.

## Future Enhancements

- Add actual trailer embeds for each film (links to be provided later)
- Replace placeholder images with properly licensed content
- Add more detailed analysis of each film
- Implement a timeline feature showcasing Tati's career progression
- Add a section for academic papers and critical essays about Tati's work

## Design Inspiration

The visual style of this website draws inspiration from the bright colors, geometric shapes, and playful elements seen in "Playtime" (1967). The color palette emphasizes blues, reds, and yellows that appear throughout Tati's most visually striking film.

## Browser Compatibility

The website is designed to be compatible with modern browsers including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
